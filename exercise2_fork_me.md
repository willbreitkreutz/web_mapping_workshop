# Exercise 2, Fork Me

Since we're doing a web-map, we have to have a place on the web to host our map.  Luckily GitHub provides us with a very easy way to publish public-facing websites.  They call it [GH Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Basically it works by publishing anything you put in a branch called "gh-pages" in your repository as a static site.  You might notice that the default branch in this repository is set to gh-pages, that means it's already being published as a web site.

Curious what it looks like?  Check it out here:

Now that's one ugly map isn't it!  Well, you're going to do something about that.

You don't have edit rights on my version of the map, so you are going to make a copy of this entire repository under your account, this is called _forking_ in the GitHub world.

To fork the repository into your own copy, just hit the fork button at the top of the page:

Awesome, now you have a complete copy of the workshop in your profile.

Before we get into the code, let's get a better base map set up, that green is too ugly to let slide.  [Exercise 3, Base Maps](/exercise3_base_maps.md)
